  "bio_text": "I bring my curiosity, authenticity, and multicultural experiences into my work as a psychologist. My background spans medicine and psychology, and having lived in Georgia, the Czech Republic, and now the Netherlands, I've developed a broad understanding of people and the many ways they experience life. I am drawn to the complexity of human behavior and the stories that shape who we are, and I approach my work with openness, empathy, and a genuine desire to connect. I value honesty, reflection, and growth, and I am committed to being fully present with the people I work with.\n\nI hold a master's in counseling psychology from Webster Ledien, where my training included CBT, DBT, psychodynamic therapy, and motivational interviewing, alongside supervised clinical internships supporting a broad and international client base. My studies and practical experience have given me the tools to work effectively with individuals, groups, and complex emotional challenges.\n\nI continue to participate in ongoing professional development, keeping my skills up to date with the latest in psychotherapy, mental health care, and evidence-based techniques.\n\n- NIP-nummer: 243861\n- AGB codes: practice 94069357 · provider 94119303\n- Based at: Rijn en Schiekade 13 2311 AJ Leiden\n- Approaches: CBT, DBT, Psychodynamic therapy, Motivational Interviewing"
